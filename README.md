GraphQL Todo App
Why GraphQL?

GraphQL is a powerful and flexible query language that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including the following:

Over-fetching and under-fetching: GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, which can reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance.
Complex queries: GraphQL can be used to make complex queries that would be difficult or impossible to make with REST.
API evolution: GraphQL APIs can be evolved over time without breaking existing queries.
Data typing: GraphQL APIs are strongly typed, which can help to prevent errors.
Specific problems that GraphQL can solve:

Querying nested data: GraphQL can be used to query nested data efficiently, without having to make multiple requests.
Real-time data: GraphQL can be used to build real-time data applications, such as chat apps and social media apps.
API documentation: GraphQL provides a single source of truth for API documentation, which can make it easier for developers to use your API.
In the context of a Todo App, GraphQL can be used to solve the following problems:

Reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance: GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, such as the list of todos, the details of a specific todo, or the status of a todo. This can reduce bandwidth usage and improve performance, especially for mobile devices.
Make complex queries: GraphQL can be used to make complex queries, such as filtering todos by status, priority, or due date. This can make it easier for users to find the information they need.
Evolve the API over time: GraphQL APIs can be evolved over time without breaking existing queries. This means that you can add new features or change the structure of the data without having to worry about breaking existing users.
Overall, GraphQL is a powerful and flexible query language that can be used to build a robust and scalable Todo App.
